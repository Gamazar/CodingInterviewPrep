# CodingInterviewPrep
Here is a list of some of the problems from Cracking Coding Interview, LeetCode, Pramp, GeeksforGeeks, etc.

I first started this to practice with Technical Interviews, but I ended up really enjoying the process.
Some of these problems have more efficient solutions, but these were mostly my first attempt. 

I will constantly add more problems, and update my solutions.
